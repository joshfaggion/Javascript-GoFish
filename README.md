# Javascript-GoFish

This classic card game is built purely on Javascript using the Jasmine testing language.

All the HTML is created by Javascript DOM manipulation.

No dependencies are needed to run the game, just clone the repo and open the index.html

For testing, just run the SpecRunner.html and it will run all the tests.

Enjoy!
